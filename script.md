Hi, I am building SUMTEO.

People buy books, but most never finish them.
Reading is lonely, and progress is invisible.
What is invisible is hard to sustain.

SUMTEO makes reading visible and social.
After reading, users save a favorite line and a short reflection.
That becomes an onchain Reflection NFT.
When a book is completed, a tree grows.

It is not a random collectible.
The tree is shaped by your reflections.
Your time becomes a living record.

Reading alone is fragile.
So SUMTEO supports team reading.
If a team hits five sessions per week,
a shared tree grows and the forest changes together.

Why Solana?
We need fast, low-cost minting for frequent reflections.
Solana makes large-scale consumer identity possible.

Our hypothesis is simple:
when reading becomes visible and shared,
people read more and keep reading.

We are starting pilot reading groups to test
weekly completion, retention, and reflection rate.

SUMTEO is not about speculation.
It is about growth.
What if your reading did not disappear, but grew?
